# JMax7219
The JMax7219 is a Java port of the Python library [max72190](https://github.com/rm-hull/max7219) using [Pi4J](https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j).
For more information visit the [Github page of the original max72190 library](https://github.com/rm-hull/max7219).

Currently the library only supports the Matrix but no Sevensegment displays. I can add support but I won't be able to test it because I don't have Sevensegment Displays right now.
